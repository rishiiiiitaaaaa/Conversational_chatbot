# Conversational Chatbot 🤖

Welcome to the **Conversational Chatbot** repository! This is an AI-powered chatbot built with **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning** techniques to provide a seamless conversational experience. The chatbot predicts user intents and provides relevant responses using machine learning models.

## Features ✨

- **Real-time Chat**: Engages in real-time conversations with users.
- **Intent-based Responses**: The chatbot classifies user messages into intents and provides the most appropriate response.
- **Gradio Interface**: A user-friendly and interactive frontend for chatting with the bot.

## Tech Stack 💻

- **Python**: The main programming language.
- **Keras**: For building and training deep learning models.
- **NLTK**: For Natural Language Processing tasks like tokenization and lemmatization.
- **Gradio**: For creating an interactive and user-friendly interface.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## Requirements 📦

- Python 3.x
- Gradio
- NLTK
- Keras
- NumPy

Install all required libraries by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure 📂

- `intents_old.json`: Contains various intents and patterns that the chatbot uses to predict responses.
- `words.pkl`: A pickle file containing a list of all the words used in the intents.
- `classes.pkl`: A pickle file containing a list of all possible classes (intent tags).
- `chatbot_model.h5`: The pre-trained model used by the chatbot for prediction.
- `app.py`: Main script that loads the model and interacts with users.

## How to Use 📝

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rishiiiiitaaaaa/Conversational_chatbot.git
cd Conversational_chatbot
```

2. Run the app using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will launch the chatbot in a browser window where you can interact with it.

## How it Works 🔍

1. **Message Preprocessing**:
   - The chatbot processes the user's message by tokenizing and lemmatizing the input text.
   - It creates a "bag of words" vector to represent the user's message.

2. **Intent Prediction**:
   - The processed message is passed to a pre-trained deep learning model (loaded from `chatbot_model.h5`).
   - The model predicts the intent of the message based on the learned patterns.

3. **Response Generation**:
   - Based on the predicted intent, the chatbot selects a response from a pre-defined list.
   - The response is then shown to the user.

4. **Gradio Interface**:
   - The chatbot interface is powered by Gradio, which allows for easy interaction through a web browser.

## Sample Interaction 💬

**User**: "Hello, how are you?"  
**Bot**: "Hello! I'm here to assist you. How can I help you today?"
